Product Demand forecasting is the process of estimating the demand for a product or services in
the future based on historical data, market trends, and other relevant factors. The purpose of
product demand forecasting is to ensure that a company can meet the demand for its product while
minimizing the risk of overproduction or underproduction.

The proposed system will utilize advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to
analyze historical sales data, market trends, seasonality, and other relevant variables. It will offer
real-time insights and predictions, adapting to changing market conditions for improved accuracy. 

In the model that is proposed logistic regression is implemented. In the model the dataset is divided in a 7:3 ratio for train to test.
1. Collecting Data:-
We receive data in the form of text files or.xlsx files for Microsoft Excel. However, in order to improve the prediction and accuracy of our model, we are collecting data from multiple sources. The accuracy of the model increases with data volume, and it is mostly dependent on the calibre of the data.
2. Data Pre-processor :-
After gathering multiple records, pre-processing of customer data occurs. There are customer records in the dataset some of which have missing data. The remaining records are used for pre-processing after those records were eliminated from the dataset. For the properties of the given dataset, multiclass variables and binary classification are introduced.
3. Feature Selection:-
Two of the 13 features in the data set one each for age and sex are used to identify the customers personal information. The 11 remaining qualities are significant because they include crucial customer records. Logistic regression is one of the ML approaches employed in this experiment, as was previously indicated. All 13 attributes were used in the experiment, which was replicated with each ML technique.
4. Train the model:-
This step comprises selecting the most appropriate technique and creating a model to represent the data. The cleaned data is split into two categories-train and test-with the ratios varying based on the prerequisites. The first category-training data is used to build the model. The test data in the second section acts as a guide.
